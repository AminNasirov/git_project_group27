How is Software Testing Done?
Testing are done manually and automatically.



What to test in software testing?

-Documents : are tested in the early steps of SDLC to prevent bugs.
-Codes : that developers created to build the app.
- The Software / system itself from a function and non-functional perspective.




Who performs Testing?
- Business team members & Designers :Test SRS, SDS and many other business docs called static testing.
- Developers : Test SRS, SDS and many other business docs called static testing.
- Testers : is divided into two parts: functional & non-functional testing. Functional testers test the application's
 Functionality; performance testers check the application's Non-Functional aspects.


- The client / stakeholders
- End users

=================================


What is static testing ?  What is the testing object / target? 

-Static Testing is a type of a Software Testing method which is performed to 
check the defects in software without actually executing the code.

of development to avoid errors. 

Static Testing also called (Verification Process) : and the Verification Process are 
-Requirement Gathering
-Designing

-Documents are tested in three ways/meetings:
.Review
.Walkthrough
.Inspection


========================================

What is dynamic testing? What is being tested? 
-Dynamic testing requires the code to be executed, 
and it requires performing both Manual and Automatic testing.

=======================================================================

What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing? 

-Functional testing ensures that functions and features of the application work properly.
- Nonfunctional testing examines other aspects of how well the application works.

Grooming meetings
Giving Fibonaci points to user stories
after
